Abstract:

Sea turtles are known to migrate large distances between their foraging and breeding grounds. Olive ridley turtles migrate annually in November to the east coast of India from their foraging grounds in the Bay of Bengal and form large aggregations at Gahirmatha and Rushikulya, two globally significant mass nesting rookeries in Odisha. 

Inter- and intra-annual variations in the density and distribution of olive ridley turtles were examined in the nearshore waters of Rushikulya from 2012-2022 using line transects. Densities of turtles were estimated for each month (December - February) for each field season and aggregations were spatially delineated using Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP). Here we provide two datasets: one contains information on the line transects and transect-specific co-variate data. The other dataset contains individual locations of turtles observed during a transect during each survey month from 2012 to 2022. 

All analyses were done in R (2020). The densities of turtles were estimated for each month for each field season in R (2020) using the package ‘distance’ by Miller et al. 2019. These locations were used to construct MCPs using the package ‘adehabitat’ by Calenge (2018). Our results show that turtle densities and locations of aggregations change considerably within and during a nesting season in Rushikulya and the aggregations occupy a small portion of the demarcated no-fishing zone.

Notes:

Data is in CSV format and can be viewed in Microsoft Excel, R and R Studio. The following R packages were used for analysis: ‘Distance’ by Miller et al. (2019) and ‘adehabitat’ by Calenge (2006).
